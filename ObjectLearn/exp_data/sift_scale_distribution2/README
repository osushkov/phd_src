I logged the scale of all SIFT features in a number of 
scenarios. I aggregated the occurance of different scale 
SIFT features into 128 "bins". Each bin is of width 0.25 
and together they span the scales from 0 to 32.
Each file contains the aggregate list of the bin counts 
for a scenario. The bin aggregates are in increasing 
order of scale.
